# Automatic Weed Detection

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for automatic weed detection using machine learning techniques. The project aims to develop a robust system that can identify and differentiate weeds from crops in agricultural fields using image processing and computer vision algorithms.

## Features
- Pre-trained models for weed detection.
- Scripts for image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.
- Integration with popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-weed-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset of images containing crops and weeds.
2. Preprocess the images (optional but recommended).
3. Extract features from the preprocessed images.
4. Train the model using the extracted features.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
6. Deploy the model for real-time weed detection.

For detailed instructions on each step, please refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` directory.
